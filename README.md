wxRedis Simple UI
=================

A simple wxWidgets based front end for Redis server.

It's started in my free time to learn Redis, wxWidgets, CMake and C++ in the same time and I am not expert on all those topics, so you can expect bugs and inefficiencies :)

Dependencies
------------
- Hiredis (https://github.com/redis/hiredis)
- wxWidgets (http://wxwidgets.org), I used the version 2.9.4
- CMake (http://cmake.org)

I just tested and compiled successfully on Linux (ArchLinux and CentOS)
